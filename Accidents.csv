Have you been following reporting in Delhi? The hospitals are already not admitting patients. AIIMS have their beds restocked for VIPs. And thatâ€™s all besides the point. Imagine you visiting USA,get into an accident,& hospitals denying treatment because you are not American!
If someone from other states meet with an accident in Delhi then he has to search admission in centeral government hospital like AIIMS or die on road.

@TrafflineDEL jam on MG road heading from Delhi-Gurgaon due to accident at Ghitorni red light. Other side clear.
@ArvindKejriwal sir a road in West Delhi...dhulsiras road and golf course road..is epitome of dust lying byside..leading to so much of pollution..us it's damaged beyond description near to Dhul siras village...leading to accidents..pls help as no MLA has visited this road...pls
Accidents like the recent one on Golf Course Road,Gurgaon can be curtailed if roads in Delhi and NCRstretches have many more cameras that heavily fine vehicles that speed.Kolkata has done it. Accidents always happen due to speeding not traffic intensity.
Sad news,on Manoj Chakrawarty,of Delhi's Ambedkar Nagar,& a DJ in a #Gurgaon's Hotel,killed by a (drunk?) SUV dr on Golf Course Rd underpass.  Hope @gurgaonpolice PREVENT more such accidents,& reward the cab driver who took him to Hospi.  #FarishteDilliKe  @AAPGurgaon @AnkitLal

@ArvindKejriwal sir after the Mumbai fire accident,I request you to take a close look at the pubs and bars of Delhi especially the hauz khas village. As we are heading to celebrate New Yearâ€™s Eve thousands of people gonna be there.  #MumbaiFire #Peoplesafety #KamalaMillsFire
http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/hauz-khas-village-under-delhi-high-court-lens-for-illegal-construction/684171/Â â€¦ Delhi's Hauz Khas is another example.. it is a major hotspot for tourists,recreational activities and party goers... It is an accident waiting to happen
Shocked to hear about #KamalaMills accident - @nivedithg and I keep visiting that place often :( Fire exit plans need to be more stricter at these kind of places and also hauz khas and khan market in Delhi..

@dtptraffic There is an accident of 2 cars outside IIT Delhi on Outer Ring Road. The 2 idiots are fighting in the middle of the road and there is a massive traffic jam from Hauz Khas Metro to IIT Delhi.

"Google "" Scindia in 1982 was involved in a traffic accident near IIT","Delhi main gate while driving a car at 2 AM. ""   Guess who was the co-passenger"
PC Chako is it true that Sonia had intense friendship with Madhavrao Scindia in the UK,which continued even after her marriage. One night at 2 AM in 1982,Madhavrao Scindia and Sonia Gandhi were caught alone together when their car met an accident near IIT Delhi main gate
Don't u know tht Sonia hd an intense friendship wth Madhavarao Scindia in U.K. & continued even after marriage. One night at 2 AM in 1982,Madhavrao Scindia and Sonia Gandhi were caught alone together when their car met an accident near IIT Delhi main gate.
On a midnight in front of d IIT Delhi a car met wth an accident & d students who were around there rushed to help d passengers whn they saw sonia running frm d left side front door & madhava Rao scindia injured on d steering wheel.
But manio was also involved in accident.. Infront of iit Delhi with some sindhiya. It was strange accident... He died few months later
Kya pata Priyanka ka DNA Jyoti se match ho jaye ... after all there was an accident near iit Delhi gate ... ambassador car ... occupants were Madhav n Antonio Maino... fun time spent together
Technology can help reduce all types of accidents and IIT Delhi is setting up a technology-oriented cell on all safety related issues': Prof @ramgopal_rao,Director,IITDhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/strict-action-cuts-traffic-violations-on-iit-d-campus/articleshow/67921371.cms?utm_campaign=andapp&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=native_share_trayÂ â€¦
When did Antonio Maino born? What was she doing with Madhavrao Scindia in a car when an accident happened near IIT Delhi at 2 AM ? Why didn't she agree to give DNA of @RahulGandhi upon murder of Rajiv Khan?
That is poor potoshop but poor guy could not get photograph of late Sindia and Antonio maino at 2 AM in 1982,in the minor accident near IIT Delhi main gate!
In 1982,Sonia while traveling with Madhav Rao Scindia met met with an accident at midnight near IIT Delhi main gate.  Students of IITD rescued them    Raghu Ram Rajan was studying at IITD then  @Swamy39
It's not a fake story.. night in 1982,Madhavrao's car accident occurred in front of the gate of IIT Delhi and at that time the second person in the car was Sonia Gandhi. Both were injured,an IIT student helped them,got out of the car.. Both were drunk...
Sonia Gandhi had intense friendship with Scindia in theÂ UK,which continued even after her marriage. One night at 2 AM in 1982,Madhavrao Scindia and Sonia Gandhi were caught alone together when their car met an accident near IIT Delhi main gate.   It's true ? @DrGPradhanFC
Sonia Gandhi had intense friendship with Madhavrao Scindia in theÂ UK,which continued even after her marriage. One night at 2 AM in 1982,Madhavrao Scindia and Sonia Gandhi were caught alone together when their car met an accident near IIT Delhi main gate.
Aur inki madam jo iit delhi ke car accident se pehle driver (scindia) ke sath gulchharre uda rahi thi uske character ki kya baat karein.
@JM_Scindia @RahulGandhi What Sonia & Madhavrao Scindhia were doing at 2am?   In 1982 Sonia Gandhi & Madhavrao Scindia was travelling in a car met a traffic accident near IIT Delhi main gate while driving a car at 2 AM. Sonia was the only other passenger. Both were badly injured
Scindia might be thinking about alleged 1982 car accident at 2AM near IIT delhi. Sonia was the only other passenger. Both were badly injured. https://twitter.com/Jairam_Ramesh/status/1237377881103372291Â â€¦pic.twitter.com/8TbLNDLQMW
He was in a wrong party @INCIndia.    He knew lots of inner secrets of Sonia. Remember the late night car accident near IIT Delhi gate in 1980s carrying Sonia & him.    His death was definitely a conspiracy.
The accident happened at hauz khas near iit delhi. Sonia mata was with madhav rao scindia..... As told by IIT delhi ites. No proof.
Please tell of history as well...madhav scindhia dating Sonia Gandhi,injured in accident near IIT,Delhi.....madhav scindhia being murdered for opposing Itlaian mafiosi...or your masters paid you to sing their dirty song...
