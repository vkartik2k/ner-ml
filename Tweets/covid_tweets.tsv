Will power is mightier than COVID-19: Tune in to hear Shri Rohit Rajbir Singh, Addl. DCP, Najafgarh, New Delhi narrate his personal experience of getting infected and coming back stronger to serve the nation - https://www.mygov.in/podcast/mygov-positive-stories-episode-103/ …
@ArvindKejriwal  namaskar our dear honorable CM, I want to give a suggestion for delhi covid patient the government have to take over the radha sawmi satsang bhawan at chhatarpur and convert it into covid hospital  it has a huge area so all the covid suffering patients can stay.
Why in chhatarpur testing of covid-19 is very less ?, in fact minimum in sagar division, even till now 5 shramic trains at reached chhatarpur ,Today 1 +ve case comes (whose testing is done in delhi) , why district officers are so irresponsible @collchhatarpur @CMMadhyaPradesh
Sir Iam  stuck in delhi with my children's in one room due to fear of covid cant go out being more than month no job and loosing money I want to go back to my home in Chhatarpur
@PMOIndia @ArvindKejriwal   vulnerable little children , mass exodus  migrant workers  fear Covid , terror hunger walking cycling Delhi to Chhatarpur 600 km - this could have been done better !  @save @pragyavats @SavetheChildren Speak up !pic.twitter.com/QFierUKfxF
One day trip to Maldives is more cheaper than spending a day in Delhi Max Life Hospital for COVID-19 patients. Trust me, medical sector is becoming a business in our country!!! pic.twitter.com/J6An3ydS7F
Looking at Covid-19, universities like Delhi and  chhattisgarh took a good decision by promoting 1st and 2nd year students.  Gujarat Universities also needs to learn from them.@nsui @NSUIGujarat #Save_Gujarat_Students
Glad to see @Radhika_Khera give back to the news anchors in the same currency that they deserve, countering their RHETORICAL WHATABOUTERY with FACTS on how Maharashtra govt is handling #COVID__19 with INNOVATIVE RESPONSIBILITY & not running away from the situation like Delhi govt

@ArvindKejriwal You’re CM of Delhi but resident of Kaushambi. (U.P.), so in case you’re tested COVID positive (I wish u don’t) you’ll seek medical facilities in Delhi or CM @myogiadityanath will be looking after providing medical help just as the way he must for every citizen?
@ArvindKejriwal developed covid symptoms. He used to live in Kaushambi , Ghaziabad before shifting to his official residence in Delhi (which is not permanent) .Acrdng to new rule only Delhites hve right to get treatment in Delhi. Where he will treat himself?  @republic plz poll
@ArvindKejriwal you said pvt hospital only for Delhiites so why fought election from delhi, your residents in Kaushambi.don't play political card in covid crisis. You are not paying their hospital bills they are paying themselves.

One of my client resides in Model Town.... His entire family has developed COVID-19 symptoms, but haven't got tested due to stigma attached.  They have just resorted to Self quarantine for past week or so.  If there is any casualty will it be a fault of Delhi Government?

57 migrants stranded in Delhi's Mundka, borrowed and paid over Rs 2 lakh to a truck driver and reached native places. Shocked when they said, if @RailMinIndia had allowed, they were ready to book whole train by paying Rs 3,500 each. #MigrantWorkers #Covid_19

@himachalpolice Sir, I wanted to enquire about the passenger limit on Inter-state travel, We are a family of 4, with a personal car, staying in South West Delhi, Palam Village (out of any containment zone). I haven't applied for Covid E-pass. (1/2)
Maybe it was impractical, due to COVID positive case in Janakpuri in the beginning of Lockdown 3, the entire district of SW Delhi was put in red zone, which include Palam which is ~6.5 KM far from Janakpuri.
Heat Wave condition intensifies in Delhi - maximum temperature recorded is 47.6 degree Celsius in Palam today.   Time to save ourselves from heatwave and Covid-19 both.  #Staysafe #heatwave #Delhiweather #DelhiFightsCoronapic.twitter.com/K7sWoVfevE
Utter confusion with regard to partial relief on lockdown in Delhi. I own one warehouse cum small assembly unit of home entertainment products falling in Palam village of south-west Delhi. Can I operate the unit by following COVID-19 norms ? Do I need separate permission for it ?

According to you supreme court spreading lie bcz they don't like honest Politics of AAP.  "The Supreme Court on Friday called patient care during the Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi "horrendous" and "pathetic", and sought explanation from the @ArvindKejriwal government in five days."
Show me a single clip of ndtv whereby they are criticising AAP for such decision which is been overruled by Lt or on orders of supreme court regarding delhi covid ,criticising maha govt for such high cases in maharastra or to congress for death of elephant !!
So what do u want?? Each state will now make hospital for their state residents only??  How will u classify that who is a delhite n who isn't?? Did u listened what Supreme court commented over Delhi covid situation??

Mr. Sisodiya, Try COVID spread  research on MLAs of Delhi and operate Delhi Vidhan sabha for 1 month. Don't try on school children. Neither everyone is capable of spending Lacs on COVID treatment nor have approach to get admission in hospitals. 
In Delhi Vidhan sabha employees have been tested positive for Covid-19 but the office is still operational and only 25-28 employees have been tested for Covid-19 till now. Why Delhi govt is not concerned for its own employees. Why the office is still operational @ArvindKejriwal
